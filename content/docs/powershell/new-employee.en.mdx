## Context

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.

During my first work/study apprenticeship at a group of universities, I had to onboard about a hundred new employees.

I decided to create this script to simplify and automate the entire process.

By optimizing the preparation of equipment for new hires, I was able to reduce the required time and thus have more time for other tasks.
## Step-by-step Script Breakdown

<DynamicCallout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Execution Logging ###
Generates a log entry containing the user's name and the script execution date, stored on a network share *(~2 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Request Employee Information ###
Prompts the user to enter the first and last name of the new employee. Then generates a PC name based on this information *(~2 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Renaming the PC ###
Suggests a name based on the entered first and last name, limits it to 15 characters if necessary, requests confirmation, and then renames the machine *(~10 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Antivirus Verification and Installation ###
Checks if an antivirus is already installed. If not, installs the latest version *(~3 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Selecting an Admin Account ###
Displays a list of available admin accounts to join the domain. Prompts the user to select one *(~2 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Connecting to the Domain "mydomain.fr" ###
Uses the selected admin account to join the PC to the domain *(~10 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Generating the Employee Identifier ###
Creates a unique identifier based on the first and last name, in the format expected by the domain *(~1 second)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Adding the User to the Local Administrators Group ###
Automatically adds the user to the "Administrators" group via a scheduled task that runs at the next startup *(~3 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Alternative for Custom Username ###
If I prefer to manually enter the account to add to the administrators group, this option is provided *(~4 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Updating the Excel Inventory ###
Updates an Excel file in a shared folder, containing the PC and user information *(~3 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
### Generating and Printing the Loan Form ###
Creates a Word form with the employee and equipment information, then automatically prints it *(~4 seconds)*.
</Step>

</Steps>

### Script to simplify and automate the preparation of a laptop for integrating a new employee. ###

### Summary of tasks: ###

### • Install the latest version of our antivirus ###  
### • Join the PC to the correct domain "mydomain.fr" ###  
### • Add the employee's account to the local admin group ###  
### • Update the inventory (an Excel file) and print a laptop loan form for the employee ###

### To see who executed which script at which date/time ###

$username23 = "$env:USERDOMAIN\$env:USERNAME"
$date23 = Get-Date -Format "dd/MM/yyyy à HH:mm:ss"
$log23 = "$username23 executed the script: prep_pcintegration.bat on $date23"
Add-Content -Path "\\adds01\Integration\prep_pcintegration.log" -Value $log23

### Ask the user: the first and last name of the new employee and take only the first letter of the first name followed by the last name for the PC name ###

$global:prenom = Read-Host `n, "Enter the first name of the employee "
$global:nom = Read-Host `n, "Enter the last name of the employee "

### If the full name exceeds 15 characters, take only the first 15 characters, example of a complete PC name ("APESCASIO") ###

### Rename the PC only if the user confirmed with 'o' ###

### Install Antivirus with the script "antivirusintegration_ap.bat" if not installed... (after antivirus installation, there will be the Antivirus folder in C:\Program Files so if it doesn't exist, it's because it's not installed)... ###
