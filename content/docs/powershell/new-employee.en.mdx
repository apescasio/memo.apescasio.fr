## Context

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.

During my first work/study apprenticeship at a group of universities, I had to onboard about a hundred new employees.

I decided to create this script to simplify and automate the entire process.

By optimizing the preparation of equipment for new hires, I was able to reduce the required time and thus have more time for other tasks.

## Step-by-step Script Breakdown

<DynamicCallout>

<Steps>

<Step>
  ### Execution Logging ### 
  Generates a log entry containing the user's name and
  the script execution date, stored on a network share *(~2 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Request Employee Information ### 
  Prompts the user to enter the first and
  last name of the new employee. Then generates a PC name based on this
  information *(~2 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Renaming the PC ### 
  Suggests a name based on the entered first and last
  name, limits it to 15 characters if necessary, requests confirmation, and then
  renames the machine *(~10 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Antivirus Verification and Installation ### 
  Checks if an antivirus is
  already installed. If not, installs the latest version *(~3 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Selecting an Admin Account ### 
  Displays a list of available admin accounts
  to join the domain. Prompts the user to select one *(~2 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Connecting to the Domain "mydomain.fr" ### 
  Uses the selected admin account
  to join the PC to the domain *(~10 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Generating the Employee Identifier ### 
  Creates a unique identifier based
  on the first and last name, in the format expected by the domain *(~1
  second)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Adding the User to the Local Administrators Group ### 
  Automatically adds
  the user to the "Administrators" group via a scheduled task that runs at the
  next startup *(~3 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Alternative for Custom Username ### 
  If I prefer to manually enter the
  account to add to the administrators group, this option is provided *(~4
  seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Updating the Excel Inventory ### 
  Updates an Excel file in a shared folder,
  containing the PC and user information *(~3 seconds)*.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Generating and Printing the Loan Form ### 
  Creates a Word form with the
  employee and equipment information, then automatically prints it *(~4
  seconds)*.
</Step>

</Steps>

## PowerShell Script
```ps1 title="prep_pcintegration.ps1"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

### Script to simplify and automate the preparation of a laptop for integrating a new employee.

### Summary of tasks:

### • Install the latest version of our antivirus

### • Join the PC to the correct domain "mydomain.fr"

### • Add the employee's account to the local admin group

### • Update the inventory (an Excel file) and print a laptop loan form for the employee

### To see who executed which script at which date/time

$username23 = "$env:USERDOMAIN\$env:USERNAME"
$date23 = Get-Date -Format "dd/MM/yyyy à HH:mm:ss"
$log23 = "$username23 executed the script: prep_pcintegration.bat on $date23"
Add-Content -Path "\\adds01\Integration\prep_pcintegration.log" -Value $log23

### Ask the user: the first and last name of the new employee and take only the first letter of the first name followed by the last name for the PC name

$global:prenom = Read-Host `n, "Enter the first name of the employee "
$global:nom = Read-Host `n, "Enter the last name of the employee "
$global:nom_pas_espace = $nom.Replace(" ", "")
$global:premierelettre*fin = $prenom.Substring(0, 1)
if ($prenom.Contains(" ")) {
$global:prenomsplit = $prenom.Split(" ")
$global:premierelettre = $prenomsplit | ForEach-Object { $*.Substring(0, 1) }
$global:premierelettre_fin = $premierelettre -join ""
}
$pc_nom = $premierelettre_fin + $nom_pas_espace

### If the full name exceeds 15 characters, take only the first 15 characters, example of a complete PC name ("APESCASIO")

if ($pc_nom.length -gt 15) {
$pc_nom15 = $pc_nom.substring(0, 15)
$pc_nom15maj = $pc_nom15.ToUpper()
Write-Output `n, $pc_nom15maj, "`nIf you forgot something, you can 'ctrl + C' 2 times to get out and start over"

#

### Rename the PC only if the user confirmed with 'o'

do {
$confirmation = Read-Host "`nDo you agree with the name of the PC?`n(Make sure to verify if a PC with the same name exists or not in the AD !"

if ($confirmation -eq "o") {
Rename-Computer -NewName $pc_nom15maj 3> $null
}
elseif ($confirmation -eq "n") {
$pc_nommaj15 = Read-Host "Enter the complete name of the PC"
Rename-Computer -NewName $pc_nommaj15 3> $null
}

else {
Write-Host `n, "Please enter 'o' or 'n' only."
}
} until ( $confirmation -eq "o" -or $confirmation -eq "n")
}

### If the full name does not exceed 15 characters

else {
$pc_nommaj = $pc_nom.ToUpper()
Write-Output `n, $pc_nommaj, "`nIf you forgot something, you can 'ctrl + C' 2 times to get out and start over"

### Rename the PC only if the user confirmed with 'o'

do {
$confirmation = Read-Host "`nDo you agree with the name of the PC?`n(Make sure to verify if a PC with the same name exists or not in the AD !"

if ($confirmation -eq "o") {
Rename-Computer -NewName $pc_nommaj 3> $null
}

elseif ($confirmation -eq "n") {
$pc_nommaj = Read-Host "Enter the complete name of the PC"
Rename-Computer -NewName $pc_nommaj 3> $null
}

else {
Write-Host `n, "Please enter 'o' or 'n' only."
}
} until ( $confirmation -eq "o" -or $confirmation -eq "n")

}

### Install Antivirus with the script "antivirusintegration_ap.bat" if not installed... (after antivirus installation, there will be the Antivirus folder in C:\Program Files so if it doesn't exist, it's because it's not installed)...

$antivirus = "C:\Program Files\Antivirus\"
if (Test-Path $antivirus) {
Write-Output "Antivirus is already installed"
}
else {
Write-Output "Installing the recent version of Antivirus"
Start-Process "\\adds01\ap_script\antivirusintegration_ap.bat"
}

### Ask the user: which account to use to join the PC to the domain:

$techs = [Ordered]@{
"1" = "Administrator"
"2" = "Tech1"
"3" = "Tech2"
}

Write-Output $techs

### Define the domain name and NETBIOS to which we will add the PC

$domain_admin = "mydomain.fr"
$domain_net = "MYDOM"
$premierelettre_fin_minuscules = $premierelettre_fin.ToLower()
$nom_minuscules = $nom.ToLower()
$domain_user = "$premierelettre_fin_minuscules$nom_pas_espace"
$sam_acc = "$domain_net\$domain_user"

do {
$choix_tech = Read-Host `n , "Choose your account"

if ($techs.Contains($choix_tech)) {
Do {

Try {
$techs_user = $techs[$choix_tech]

### Add the PC to the domain with "JoinWithNewName" and "AccountCreate" options to have it in the AD with the new PC name

$j = Add-Computer -DomainName $domain_admin -Credential $domain_net\$techs_user -Force -Options JoinWithNewName, AccountCreate -PassThru -ErrorAction Stop 3> $null

}

Catch {
$Error[0].Exception
}

} While ( $j.HasSucceeded -ne $true )
}
else {
Write-Output `n, "Please enter a number that is part of the list of technicians only."

}
} until ($techs.Contains($choix_tech))

### Add the new employee's account to the local admin group

Write-Output "`nThe user $sam_acc will be automatically added to the local admin group.."

do {
$confirmation_2 = Read-Host "Do you agree with this ?`nEnter 'o' for yes or 'n' to manually write the NETBIOS and username of the new employee"

### If 'o' is chosen, then create a scheduled task (which runs at startup) that will automatically add the new employee's AD account to the local admin group.

if ($confirmation_2 -eq "o") {
$command_addlocal = "Add-LocalGroupMember -Group Administrators -Member $sam_acc"
$command_deletetask = "schtasks /delete /tn 'ajouter_addminlocal' /f"
$command_deletefile = "rm C:\ajouter_adminlocal.ps1"
Set-Content C:\ajouter_adminlocal.ps1 -Value $command_addlocal, $command_deletetask, $command_deletefile
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'PowerShell.exe' -Argument '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ajouter_adminlocal.ps1'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -AllowStartIfOnBatteries -DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'ajouter_addminlocal' -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Settings $settings -User System -RunLevel Highest | Out-Null
}
elseif ($confirmation_2 -eq "n") {
$sam_acc_n = Read-Host "`nPlease enter the full ID of the new employee with the NETBIOS included!"
$command_addlocal = "Add-LocalGroupMember -Group Administrators -Member $sam_acc_n"
$command_deletetask = "schtasks /delete /tn 'ajouter_addminlocal' /f"
$command_deletefile = "rm C:\ajouter_adminlocal.ps1"
Set-Content C:\ajouter_adminlocal.ps1 -Value $command_addlocal, $command_deletetask, $command_deletefile
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'PowerShell.exe' -Argument '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ajouter_adminlocal.ps1'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -AllowStartIfOnBatteries -DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'ajouter_addminlocal' -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Settings $settings -User System -RunLevel Highest | Out-Null

}
else {
Write-Host `n, "Please enter 'o' or 'n' only."

}
} until ($confirmation_2 -eq "o" -or $confirmation_2 -eq "n")

### After renaming the PC + domain integration, we will now update the Excel inventory

### Set the provider in a variable to retrieve it later for the Word PC loan form

$fournisseur = Get-WmiObject -Class win32_bios | Select -ExpandProperty Manufacturer

### For Lenovo, add an "S" at the beginning of the serial number because in Excel files, Lenovo serial numbers always start with "S"

if ($fournisseur -eq "LENOVO" ) {
$global:serial = Get-WmiObject -Class win32_bios | Select -ExpandProperty serialnumber
$global:s = "S"
$global:serial = $s + $serial
}

# If it's not a LENOVO, there's nothing to do.

else {
$global:serial = Get-WmiObject -Class win32_bios | Select -ExpandProperty serialnumber
$global:serial = "$global:serial"

}

Write-Output "`nAfter renaming the PC and joining it to the administrative domain, we will now update the Excel inventory. `n`nThe serial number of the PC is: $serial"

### Ask the user: the year of the asset number (which is visible on the label under the laptop)

$immobs = [Ordered]@{
"1" = "2022\DELL_Inventory.xlsx"
"2" = "2021\DELL_Inventory.xlsx"
"3" = "2020\Gestion Parc-Lenovo.xlsx"
}

Write-Output $immobs

### The path to the Excel inventory files and the employee variable to update the Excel file with the full name of the employee

$global:employe = $nom.ToUpper() + " " + $prenom.substring(0, 1).ToUpper() + $prenom.substring(1).toLower()
$sharedfolder_inventory = "\\adds01\Stock"

### Function to update the Excel file that is in a network share ONLY IF no user has it open, if it's already open by another user, the script does nothing.

function Save-ExcelDataLoop {
[CmdletBinding()]
param ()

do {

### Ask to select the year of the asset number

$choix_immob = Read-Host "Choose the year of the asset number `n"
if ($immobs.Contains($choix_immob)) {
$choix_immob_fin = $immobs[$choix_immob]
$global:absolute = "$sharedfolder_inventory\$choix_immob_fin"
[IO.File]::OpenWrite($absolute).Close()

### Open the Excel file, then update the new inventory with the following format: Full name + PC name

$excel = New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application
$excel.Visible = $false
$workbook = $excel.Workbooks.Open($absolute)
$worksheet = $workbook.Sheets.Item(1)

$cell = $worksheet.Range("A1").EntireRow
$lastRow = $worksheet.Cells($worksheet.Rows.Count, 1).End(-4162).Row + 1
$worksheet.Cells.Item($lastRow, 1).Value = $employe
$worksheet.Cells.Item($lastRow, 2).Value = $pc_nommaj
$worksheet.Cells.Item($lastRow, 3).Value = $serial
$workbook.Save()
$workbook.Close()

}
else {
Write-Host "Please select a valid year."
}
} until ($immobs.Contains($choix_immob))
}

Save-ExcelDataLoop

### Print the form for the laptop loan

### Ask the user for the printer to use

$printer = Read-Host "`nWhich printer to use for printing the laptop loan form?"
$filename = "\\adds01\Stock\PC Loan Forms\PC_Loan_Form_Template.docx"
$doc = New-Object -ComObject Word.Application
$doc.Visible = $false
$document = $doc.Documents.Open($filename)

### Find and replace fields in the Word document

$find = $document.Content.Find
$find.Execute("{Name}", $employe)
$find.Execute("{PC_Name}", $pc_nommaj)
$find.Execute("{Serial}", $serial)

### Print the Word document to the selected printer

$document.PrintOut([Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, [Type]::Missing, $printer)

### Finish

Write-Output "`nThe laptop loan form has been printed! `nTask Completed."

```
