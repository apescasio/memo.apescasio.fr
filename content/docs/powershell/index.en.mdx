## Introduction

In this folder, you will mainly find PowerShell scripts that I created during my work/study apprenticeship.  

These scripts reflect part of what I learned and applied during that time.  

For confidentiality reasons, some sensitive details have been removed or modified, particularly those related to servers. However, the scripts remain representative of the tasks and solutions encountered in a professional context.
