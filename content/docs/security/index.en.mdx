## Introduction

As someone who likes to create, develop and administrate—I personally don’t see myself having a job purely focused on security. 

Of course, I should be aware of the risks of everything that I do, be it in my lab or in my job. 

In this folder, you will mainly find procedures on Custom domain names, Mail security implementations (SPF + DKIM + DMARC), Azure CA (Conditional Access), all on my lab tenant to simulate real work scenarios.
