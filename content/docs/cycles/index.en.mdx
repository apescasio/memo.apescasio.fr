## My past

Years ago in France, I got put in a « welcoming class / classe d'accueil » as I spoke 0 French (originally from Philippines), I was 11 at the time. 

To learn the language, I picked up some book to try and understand. 

At the beginning, I understood absolutely nothing => Le Mythe de Sisyphe par Albert Camus.

</div>


But as the days / weeks / months / years passed by, I obviously understood more, and I finished it.

Now, in the « working stage » of my life, I believe that everyone who has a job and who have their own obligations are simply pushing the rock up the mountain, just like Sisyphus.

</div>

Years later, this remains one of my favorite quotes: « One must imagine Sisyphus happy / Il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux. »

## My inspiration from novels

I'm a big reader of light novels, which are usualy written before the manga (JP) / manwha (KR) / manhua (CN) adaptations, and even before the anime.

My favorite genre is « time loops / regression. »

The light novel that inspired me the most is, without a doubt, Regressor's Tale of Cultivation by Tremendous. 

The protagonist (Seo Eun-hyun) of this novel is **literally** the reason I created this handbook in the first place. 

It also inspired the learning cycles I follow (restarting again and again), and the mantra I will forever live by.

« I have no talent. » 

« Without talent, in order to reach high places, one must be willing to die even in the evening. »

« A miraculous, incredibly grateful ability. But that's why this ability has to disappear. »

« These memories that only I will know will continue to accumulate, and the more they do, the harder it will be for my mind to endure. Hence, I will definitely go to the previous world and eliminate this power. Until then, I will strive to be human. As a human, I will live a human life. »
