title: My soul & my joy
---

## Initiative

I'm continously maintaining this handbook for for every lolo / lola / ama / ina who prayed for their kid’s future, for every kid in the Philippines / X country who ever knocked on a door for scrap metal to resell for change, and for every soul who almost gave up. May you find here not just commands and code—but hope, dignity, and the tools to reclaim your joy.

## Fraternité

Every document I created is framed as if I'm helping a a younger version of myself, or a friend. 

I invited some of my close friends to contribute guides, translations, or improvements, making this handbook: a shared project.

I'm a really big fan of quotes so I try to put some out in documents. A quote I recently read from Satya Nadella: « Don't be a know-it-all. Be a learn-it-all. »

I also created this space (discord server) where I / beginners can ask questions and help each other.

## Égalité

This handbook will never have ads nor paywalls.

The code itself is open-source as well in my GitHub.

I'll try to avoid jargon when possible and offer a beginner-friendly terms, but this is IT and we all should be learning these.

To cover more audience, I took the 4 most spoken languages : Spanish, Arabic, French and English for the translations. And I did my best to optimize this handbook for low-bandwidth and mobile users—especially important for learners in underserved areas. 

## Liberté

Anyone, no matter the background or age, anywhere, no matter the country can learn and grow without needing formal credentials.

Knowledge can always be used to uplift, not exploit.

I hope that you get inspired by this handbook of an insignificant student: to use what you learn to build tools, automate tasks, or even start your own projects.

I'll continously be saving up money to buy a gatekeepers' course, relearn what they did and recreate a better guide that's for free and open-source.

## Lost for a moment

I lost my soul and my joy. 

I got tired of letting down my kapwa—my parents, my grandparents, their friends, my siblings and my friends. 

So I just locked in, wrote down what I wanted to accomplish and I did it. Only then was I able to get my soul and joy back. It’s very easy for a human to lose these. Now that I understand this, I’ll do everything I can to never lose them again.

I fell but I got back up again on my own feet, just like my lolo taught me.
