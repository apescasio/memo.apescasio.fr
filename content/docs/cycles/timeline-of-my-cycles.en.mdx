title: Timeline of my cycles

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Context

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.

Once a month, I break everything (my own PC and my lab tenant) to rebuild it all back « brick by brick. »

Whether it be installing apps on my PC via PowerShell, or recreating Copilot AI Agents or Intune Full Cloud Autopilot profiles.

To keep track of these cycles, I created this timeline to document,
each action taken during every:  
« regression. »

## Student Arc Commitment 

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout type="warn">
**Important**: Each new action or skill learned in a cycle will be repeated and refined in all subsequent cycles. Nothing is ever truly completed — everything is continuously restarted, improved, and rebuilt from scratch in the next iteration.
</Callout>

### Azure Account Free License (1st Cycle) ###
To better understand Azure Active Directory, I decided to create my own tenant and set up an Azure AD lab. 

This allowed me to explore Azure AD features, such as user management, synchronization with an on-premise Active Directory, and integration with cloud applications.

### Reformatting PC & PowerShell (2nd Cycle) ###
I got a new SSD 2TB for my laptop, so I challenged myself by breaking everything and rebuilding it all back on the new SSD via PowerShell.

### Learning Intune & Creating Handbook (3rd Cycle) ###
I did a 30-Days trial of M365 Business Premium to learn Intune and at the same time: create « Handbook of an admin. » to document my learning process.

### Creating Copilot Agents AI Studio in « LabOfApes » (4th Cycle) ###
I got mad that Microsoft pushed changes into graphical interface of Copilot Studio, example: the trigger interface was completely revamped, so I was lost.

I ended up commiting and buying the M365 Business Premium + Copilot Studio AI Agent Add-On ($75 total a month). In my tenant « LabOfApes », I created ISO (AI for IT Department), and I plan on creating MIDL (AI for HR Department).

### ART, ALZHEIMERS-RESISTANCE-TRAINING, Python App (5th Cycle) ###

I am not a doctor, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio’s notes. 

Back in my high school days, I used to retype again and again my notes for Histoire Géo and other classes on the keyboard.

Years later, I created this Python App to train my word per minute and my memory.

I type as fast as I can and while typing, I repeat each phrase in my mind.

### ISO, INTELLIGENT-SYSTEMS-OPTIMIZATION, AI Agent Copilot Studio (6th Cycle) ###

« Arise ISO. Please reset the method of authentication for Kdot. »

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio’s notes.

A friend of mine recently sprained her wrist from doing lots of gymnastics, and I was receiving lots of voice messages.

This experience inspired me to use Voice Control on iPhone and Voice Access on Windows to run voice commands through AI Agents in Copilot Studio, creating a more intuitive and « hands-free » way to work.
