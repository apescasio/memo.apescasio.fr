import LearningCycle from '@/components/learning-cycle';
import CultureCycle from '@/components/culture-cycle';

This folder contains my procedures and my technical notes related to Azure.  

Whether it's setting up a service, understanding a concept, or finding a useful command, everything is organized to get straight to the point without wasting time.

For confidentiality reasons, some sensitive details have been removed or modified.
