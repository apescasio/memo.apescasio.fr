## Azure: What Exactly Is It?

**Azure** is Microsoft's cloud platform, offering Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). It allows you to deploy, manage, and monitor resources in globally distributed datacenters.

Among the most commonly used services:
- Virtual Machines (VM),
- Storage (Blob, File Share),
- Virtual Networks (VNet, VPN),
- Managed Databases (SQL, Cosmos DB),
- Identity and Access Services (Azure AD, RBAC),
- DevOps tools, monitoring, AI, etc.

<Callout title="Key Takeaway">
Azure is a comprehensive public cloud capable of replacing or complementing an on-premise infrastructure.

## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

**Azure AD** is Microsoft's cloud identity service. It centralizes:
- User authentication (SSO, MFA, etc.),
- Management of groups, roles, and permissions,
- Integration with thousands of SaaS applications (e.g., Office 365, Salesforce, GitHub),
- And synchronization with an on-premise Active Directory (via Azure AD Connect).

It is **not** a traditional domain controller but rather a **cloud directory** based on user identities.  
It supports standard protocols: **OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SAML, WS-Fed**.

<Callout title="Common Use Case">
Authenticating users on Office 365, managing access to internal applications, or implementing MFA via Conditional Access.

## What Is an Azure Tenant?

An **Azure tenant** is an isolated instance of Azure Active Directory associated with an organization.  
It serves as a **security context** for:
- Users,
- Applications,
- Groups,
- Roles and security policies.

Each tenant has:
- A default **domain name** (`<name>.onmicrosoft.com`),
- A **unique GUID** (`Directory (tenant) ID`),
- And can be linked to multiple Azure subscriptions.

<Callout title="Important">
An Azure subscription can exist **within** a tenant, but a tenant can exist **without a subscription**. The two are not the same.
