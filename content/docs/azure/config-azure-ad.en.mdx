title: Configure an Azure Active Directory
---
## Context

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.

To better understand Azure Active Directory, I decided to create my own tenant and set up an Azure AD lab.

This allowed me to explore Azure AD features, such as user management, synchronization with an on-premise Active Directory, and integration with cloud applications.

This guide details the steps I followed to configure an Azure AD tenant and synchronize an on-premise AD with the cloud.

## Creating an Azure Tenant

First, you need to create a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account) account, which has a completely free option.

Then, go to the portal [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) to create a new Azure AD "tenant."

## Creating my first account in tenant

Once in the new "tenant" on the portal (if not already done), create a new user. This account will be used to synchronize the on-premise AD with the "Azure AD" cloud.

Once the user is created (this will take 1 to 2 minutes), copy the user's UPN. For example: `apes@labapes.onmicrosoft.com`.

## Setting Up Azure AD Connect

For the installation of [Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=47594), I simply used the default settings.

## Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service

Once AAD Connect is configured, launch the "Synchronization Service" software to check the synchronization logs between the on-premise AD and Azure AD.

You should see "success" operations there. You can also verify in the Azure portal that the users have been successfully synchronized.

## Creating an account in AD on-premise

After these verifications, you can test creating a new user in the on-premise AD and force synchronization using the command `Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta`.

Everything works correctly, and we can see the new user!
