« Let me teach you something people often misunderstand. They say: Never be kind to the wrong person. You'll regret it. But regret only exists when your actions depend on outcomes. True strength lies in doing something not because it benefits you, but because it aligns with your will. »

« I am kind when I choose to be. Not because you deserve it. Not because I expect anything in return. But because it is my choice. Betray me, lie to me, take advantage of me. That is your nature. But my kindness, that is mine. »

« And I do not change who I am just because the world fails to meet my expectations. »

« In a world of schemers and betrayers, to remain untouched, to be kind by will, not by hope. That is not weakness. That is control. That is strength. »
