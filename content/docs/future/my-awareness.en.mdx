« You are old, Uncle. Your great ambitions and aspirations have already disappeared from your youth. These years, you have lived an easy life and it has corrupted your heart. You are vying for the family assets, not for cultivation, but to maintain your rich life. »

« They would seek their own existence and superiority by lecturing the later generations. Gu Yue Dong Tu watched on as Fang Yuan stepped into the Internal Affairs Hall, his whole body shook and veins bulged up on his forehead. »

« The light of the setting sun shone on his hair, which was already turning white. He was indeed old. When he sustained that injury at the age of 20, he had already aged. Indeed, a person is as old as his heart has aged. »
