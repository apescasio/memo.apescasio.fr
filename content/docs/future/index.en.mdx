## Introduction

I’ve reached this point thanks to my experiences and to the many connections who had supported and sustained me.

## Breakthrough gatekeeping

I believe that to change the world, you must start by changing yourself. I’ll always be saving up to buy a gatekeepers’ course (when I return in September), relearn what they’ve done, and recreate a better guide that is also free and open-source. 

This is my way of paying it forward.

I truly believe that gatekeeping are holding all of us back—whether in IT, other domains, or life itself.

I’m not going to lie and say I don’t need help. Everyone needs help. To be Human is to make mistakes—but to keep persevering is what makes us grow.

The best help you can give me is sharing what I do, through word of mouth.

My aim is to rid this world of gatekeeping and paid monthly subscriptions. 

I will not stop until my death. Hopefully, my kids will carry this on.

## Next generation

To the new students starting their first job, my only advice is this:

Stay in a company where your team consists of humans with values.

Make good use of your trial period.

You’ll be spending 8+ hours a day with these people—more time than with your own family.

Don’t waste your soul and your life away with people who lack basic values: morals, integrity, discipline, listen.

I understand that everyone has obligations, but if you can… Let those people rot in their own hole.

Keep moving forward.

I was lucky to be part of a Human team in my first job, and again in my current, second job.

I hope that in the future—one we truly can’t predict—I’ll be part of another.

And if you feel personally attacked by this message… perhaps it’s time to reconsider your choices in this « game of chess » that we call life?
