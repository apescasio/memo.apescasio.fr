title: About me
---

Neither good nor evil. These labels... they now mean nothing to me. The world insists on classifying and judging but I am beyond their scales. 

There is only, this insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio. 

My liberty, my individuality, my valor, my evolution. They belong to me and me alone. No one dictates my way of life.

To abandon or to persevere... it is not fate that decides. It is I. And I am the master of my own memories, my own actions, and my own choices.
