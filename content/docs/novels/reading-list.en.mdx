### Regressor's Tale of Cultivation by Tremendous (2024) ###

At Chapter 464 out of 810 (2M+ word count).

A Korean's take on the Xianxia genre which is very usually written by Chinese authors. 

The protagonist, Seo Eun-hyun, keeps returning to a specific point in time after each death. 

This novel is absolute cinema, it inspired me to create « Handbook of an admin. », during my day-offs in April 2025, to begin my « Learning Cycles » and to adopt a life-changing mantra of: 

---

« I have no talent. » 

---

« Without talent, in order to reach high places, one must be willing to die even in the evening. »

---

« A miraculous, incredibly grateful ability. But that's why this ability has to disappear. »

---

« These memories that only I will know will continue to accumulate, and the more they do, the harder it will be for my mind to endure. Hence, I will definitely go to the previous world and eliminate this power. Until then, I will strive to be human. As a human, I will live a human life. »

### The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus (1942) ###

I didn’t speak a word of French when I arrived in France at age 11 (originally from Philippines). 

To learn, I picked up « Le Mythe de Sisyphe » and understood absolutely nothing.

But over time, I kept reading. I finished it (40K+ word count).

Now, in the working stage of life, I believe that everyone with a job and responsibilities is simply pushing the rock up the mountain, just like Sisyphus.

Years later, this remains one of my favorite quotes: 

« One must imagine Sisyphus happy. »

« I had once screamed, gradually, I lost my voice.
I had once cried, gradually, I lost my tears.
I had once grieved, gradually, I became able to withstand everything.
I had once rejoiced, gradually, I became unmoved by the world. And now, all I have left is an expressionless face, my gaze is as tough as a monolith, only perseverance remains in my heart.

This is my own, an insignificant character, Fang Yuan's — **Perseverance!** »

[I suffered, why shouldn't they?]

[I suffered and I hope no else has to.]

« The thing is, in this world, everyone is a main character but also a side character. Everyone suffers. There is no right and wrong. Suffering is neither just nor unjust. It simply is. To waste breathe, demanding the world to conform to your pain, is to blind yourself to the chessboard. »

« Wisdom lies in playing the game, not cursing it's rules. »

[I was wrong!]

[I thought that this Fang Yuan was a heartless person or was filled with hatred and rage, that was the reason for his evil actions.]

[But the truth is, he has abundant emotions, he does not lack anything.]

[Even though he pursues strength, he is not obsessed with it.]

[What drives him to do this, is his goal.]

[This goal is deeply ingrained in his heart, not only three lifetimes, even after a hundred lifetimes, it cannot be eradicated.]

[This person cannot be reformed.]

But I wish I could.  
God, but I wish I could. »

« NO, if you do that, you won't see the end of it. »

[The end of what?]

« The evolutionary process, you of all being should know something about that. »

[Yes. Yes, I'm evolving. That's why Professor Ivo made me. These past months, I have amassed so much knowledge and yet, I remain confused, empty.]

[What am I evolving into? What is my purpose? I must know, **TELL ME!**]

« There's no way to tell, and that's why I stay in the game. My purpose, if you will, is to see where it's all going. And you, you'll live forever, you'll be able to see it all. »

[Is that my purpose, simply to be, a witness?]

« We create our own purpose in life, now go create yours. »

When you stand before God, you cannot say that I was told by others to do thus, or that virtue was not convenient at the time. This will not suffice, remember that. »

« Good morning, brother! Morning, morning, MORNING! »
