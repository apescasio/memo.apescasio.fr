title: Configure SSH on a VPS
---
## Context

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.

Instead of allowing password authentication on my VPS, I wanted to remove it and enforce SSH key authentication.

## Local PC

First, I generate an SSH key.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

I press the "Enter" key 3 times, then copy the full content of the generated `.pub` file.

## VPS

I connect to my server.

```bash
ssh username@Your_VPS_IPv4 -p PortNumber
```

I create the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file (if it doesn't already exist) and paste the content of the `.pub` file into it.

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Finally, I disable password authentication and restart the SSH service using this bash script.

```bash title="update-sshdconfig.sh"
sudo sed -i "s/^#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
I reconnect to my server and normally no password will be asked.

```bash
ssh username@Your_VPS_IPv4 -p PortNumber
```
