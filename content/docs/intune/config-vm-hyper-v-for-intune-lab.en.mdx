title: Configure a VM for a lab Intune  
---

## Context

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.

I wanted to enroll a virtual machine (VM) for my lab Intune.

To do this, I chose to use Hyper-V to familiarize myself with this tool instead of continuing with VMware Workstation, which I always used at IPI school.

<Callout title="Key Takeaway">  
Hyper-V is a native virtualization solution integrated into Windows, ideal for professional environments and virtual machine testing. Hyper-V is free with Windows Pro/Enterprise, whereas VMware Workstation requires a paid license.  
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

To use Hyper-V on my PC, the following prerequisites are required:

- A PC running one of the following versions of Windows: Windows 10/11 Enterprise, Windows 10/11 Education, or Windows 10/11 Pro.  
- A 64-bit processor that supports Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).  
- A processor compatible with virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT-x.  
- At least 4 GB of RAM, though 8 or 16 GB is recommended for better performance.  

## Enable Hyper-V using `optionalfeatures.exe`

I ran PowerShell as Administrator to execute the following command, which forces Windows' Boot Configuration Data (BCD) to load the hypervisor automatically at startup.

```ps1
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
```

Next, I ran the `optionalfeatures.exe` command to enable Hyper-V and restarted my PC.

## Check `systeminfo`

Before starting, I ran the `systeminfo` command to ensure everything was ready on my PC.

## Hyper-V Manager

After rebooting, I could see the Hyper-V Manager.

## Configure a Virtual Network Switch

Hyper-V offers three types of virtual switches, each with specific use cases:

1. **External Virtual Switch**  
   This type of switch allows the virtual machine to use one of the physical network adapters on my PC (RJ45 Ethernet or Wi-Fi). This gives the VM access to the same network connection as my PC, including Internet access.

2. **Internal Virtual Switch**  
   With this type of switch, the virtual machine can communicate with the Hyper-V host (my PC) and other virtual machines connected to the same switch. However, it will not have access to the external network connection of my PC.

3. **Private Virtual Switch**  
   This switch offers a higher level of isolation. Virtual machines connected to this type of switch can only communicate with each other, without interaction with the Hyper-V host or the external network.

To enroll my virtual machine, it needs Internet access.  

So, I created an "External" virtual switch.

I selected my network adapter (RJ45).

Then I applied the changes.

## Creating a VM for my lab Intune

Instead of using the "Quick Create" feature in Hyper-V, I preferred to manually download the ISO from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) and perform the installation myself.

Then, I clicked on "New > Virtual Machine."

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Create VM 1](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-create-vm-1.png)

I named the VM.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Create VM 2](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-create-vm-2.png)

I chose Generation 2.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Create VM 3](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-create-vm-3.png)

For RAM, I allocated 4 GB and unchecked the dynamic memory option because I didn’t want the VM to use more than 4 GB, as I fixed this value.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Create VM 4](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-create-vm-4.png)

I selected the switch I created earlier.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Create VM 5](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-create-vm-5.png)

I created the VHDX and allocated 70 GB for storage.

Very important: Windows 11 requires a minimum of 64 GB. Otherwise, it won’t work.  
</Callout>

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Create VM 6](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-create-vm-6.png)

I selected the ISO I downloaded and clicked "Finish."

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Create VM 7](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-create-vm-7.png)

Before starting the VM, I enabled Secure Boot + Trusted Platform Module; otherwise, the installation wouldn’t proceed.

## Starting the VM

Once the VM was created, I started it and pressed a key continuously to boot from the ISO.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 1](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-1v2.png)

I selected the AZERTY keyboard layout.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 2](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-2.png)

I clicked "Install Windows 11" and checked the box.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 3](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-3.png)

On the product key request page, I chose "I don't have a product key" since this is a test VM.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 4](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-4.png)

I selected the Pro version. If I kept the Home version, I wouldn’t be able to enroll the VM in my lab Intune.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 5](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-5.png)

I clicked "Accept."

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 6](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-6.png)

I clicked "Next."

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 7](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-7.png)

Finally, I clicked "Install."

After a coffee break, I arrived at the country selection page.

![Hyper-V Switch Manager - Start VM 9](/images/intune/hyper-v/hyper-v-start-vm-9.png)

This is the page where I can start a Windows Autopilot!

Very important: First, take a snapshot with "Ctrl + N." If needed, you can always return to this "fresh" state.
