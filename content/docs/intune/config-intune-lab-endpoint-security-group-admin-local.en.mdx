## Creating an `Endpoint Security/Account Protection` Policy

By default, I wanted the "Administrators" group on the devices to include the "technicians" group, so I created this policy in "Endpoint Security > Account Protection".

I selected the "platform" as Windows and the "profile" as Local user group membership.

I named the policy.

I clicked on "Add" and then on "Select users/group" to select the group I want to add to the local admin group on the devices.

I left the "Scope tags" as default.
