## Enrolling a Second VM

To confirm that the Autopilot profile, Google Chrome package, and local admin policy are correctly applied to the dynamic group, I enrolled a second VM.

I can see the profile as Assigned on the device, so I continued the provisioning by restarting the VM and logging in.

The Google Chrome package installed correctly, and the transcript log is also available in `C:\ProgramData\Lab\Intune`.

I was able to log in with the second account "IT@LABAPES01.onmicrosoft.com" and could also execute as an admin, so the policy worked!
