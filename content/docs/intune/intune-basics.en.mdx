title: Basics of Intune
---

## What is Intune?

**Microsoft Intune** is a cloud solution for mobile device management (MDM - **Mobile Device Management**) and mobile application management (MAM - **Mobile Application Management**). It allows companies to remotely manage workstations, laptops, phones, and tablets, whether they are personal (BYOD) or company-owned.

With Intune, you can:
- Deploy configurations (Wi-Fi, VPN, restrictions, etc.).
- Push applications (Win32, MSI, store apps).
- Apply security policies.
- Manage Windows Update policies, define rings, and control updates.
- Ensure device compliance through rules.

Intune integrates closely with Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365, making it a key component of Microsoft's modern management strategy.

<Callout title="Key Takeaway">
Intune is a cloud solution for device and application management, ideal for modern environments and BYOD strategies.

## What is Windows Autopilot?

**Windows Autopilot** is a feature complementary to Intune that allows you to prepare and automatically deploy Windows devices without using a traditional image.

Specifically:
- The new device must first be **enrolled in the Windows Autopilot service** (via a script or by the OEM).
- An Autopilot profile is assigned to the device in Intune.
- The technician activates the **White Glove** mode by pressing the Windows key 5 times, then selects "Provision with Windows Autopilot" to prepare the device for use.
- The device is ready to use in just a few simple steps.

Autopilot transforms the deployment process into a seamless user experience while reducing the burden on IT teams.

<Callout title="Key Takeaway">
Autopilot automates Windows deployment but requires prior device registration and profile assignment. It can be used for self-deployment or pre-provisioned by IT before delivery.

## What is the difference between Intune and System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)?

**System Center Configuration Manager (formerly SCCM, now MECM)** is an older on-premise solution often used in traditional environments to manage Windows devices (inventory, OS deployment, patching, etc.).

**Microsoft Intune**, on the other hand, is 100% cloud-based, focused on mobility and modern management.

| Solution       | SCCM         | Intune         |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Infrastructure | On-premise   | Cloud          |
| OS Deployment  | Strong       | Limited (via Autopilot) |
| Scope          | Primarily Windows | Multi-platform (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows) |
| BYOD Scenarios | Limited      | Strongly supported |

Today, both can coexist via **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**, which unifies their management in a single hybrid console.

<Callout title="Key Takeaway">
SCCM is on-premise, Intune is cloud-based. They can be used together via Microsoft Endpoint Manager to leverage the best of both worlds.
