## Creating an Autopilot Profile

I created a new profile by navigating to "Devices > Enrollment > Deployment profiles".

![Creating an Autopilot profile](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-1.png)

I named the profile and left the "No" option to avoid converting all devices to "Autopilot".

I configured the OOBE for the profile with the following settings:

- **Deployment mode**: User-Driven
- **Join to Microsoft Entra ID as**: Microsoft Entra joined (Full Cloud)
- **Microsoft Software License Terms**: Hide
- **Privacy settings**: Hide
- **Hide change account options**: Hide
- **User account type**: Standard
- **Allow pre-provisioned deployment**: Yes
- **Language (Region)**: Operating system default
- **Automatically configure keyboard**: Yes
- **Apply device name template**: Yes
- **Enter a name**: FRLAB-%SERIAL%

For groups, I didn’t assign any for now; I’ll do that later.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 4](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-4.png)

The Autopilot profile was successfully created.

## First Attempt to Enroll a VM

To create a dynamic group that will include all devices with the "FRLAB" category, the device must first exist in Intune.

<Callout type="warn">
During the creation of the dynamic group, Microsoft will display an error message as long as no device with the "FRLAB" category exists.
</Callout>

So, I powered on my Windows 11 VM (running on Hyper-V) and pressed `Shift + F10` to open a command prompt on the VM.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 6](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-6.png)

Then, I switched the terminal to PowerShell.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 7](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-7.png)

Next, I installed the "WindowsAutopilotInfo" script and executed the command to associate the "FRLAB" group tag with the device.

```ps1
Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Force
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Online -GroupTag 'FRLAB'
```

After running the command "Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Online -GroupTag 'FRLAB'", I logged in with my global admin account and approved the request to set up an Enterprise App "MS Graph Command Line Tools".

![Creating an Autopilot profile 10](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-10.png)

According to the output, the VM was successfully enrolled!

![Creating an Autopilot profile 11](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-11.png)

The VM is also visible in the Intune console.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 12](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-12.png)

Now that there’s a device in Intune, I added it to the "FRLAB-FullCloud-StaticGroup" group to later assign the Autopilot profile to it.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 13](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-13.png)

I then assigned the "FRLAB-FullCloud-StaticGroup" group to the Autopilot profile.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 14](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-14.png)

After about 15 minutes of waiting, the "Profile status" changed to "Assigned", and the Autopilot profile was applied!

![Creating an Autopilot profile 15](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-15.png)

Once the Autopilot profile was applied, I started the "White Glove Deployment" by pressing the "Windows" key 5 times.
<Callout type="warn">
I had to open the VM in fullscreen because otherwise, pressing the "Windows" key 5 times didn’t work.
</Callout>

![Creating an Autopilot profile 16](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-16.png)

Then I clicked on "Next".

![Creating an Autopilot profile 17](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-17.png)

And I got stuck with this error message.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 18](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-18.png)

## Error `TPM attestation timed out`

According to [Microsoft’s article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/known-issues#pre-provisioning-gives-an-error-screen), it’s not possible to perform Pre-provisioning with Windows Autopilot on virtual machines (VMs).

<Callout type="warn">
This only works on physical hardware that is compatible with Windows Autopilot.
The "TPM attestation timed out" issue is therefore normal in a Hyper-V VM.
</Callout>

## Second Attempt to Enroll a VM

Even though Pre-provisioning isn’t possible on a VM, standard provisioning with Windows Autopilot is entirely feasible.

First, I reverted to a previous checkpoint of my VM.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 19](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-19.png)

I also deleted the device from the Intune console.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 20](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-20.png)

I reinstalled the script and reran the Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo command.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 21](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-21.png)

I added the device to the group.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 22](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-22.png)

After 15 minutes of waiting, the "Profile status" changed to "Assigned", and I could see the "FRLAB" GroupTag.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 23](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-23.png)

I returned to the VM and restarted it.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 27](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-27.png)

After restarting, I logged in once with my account.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 28](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-28.png)

Then, I configured Windows Hello.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 29](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-29.png)

I successfully enrolled the first VM in my Intune lab!

![Creating an Autopilot profile 30](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-30.png)

The device is also visible in the Intune console with the name "FRLAB-%SERIAL%". The serial number wasn’t fully included due to a 15-character limit.

![Creating an Autopilot profile 31](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-31.png)

## Creating a Dynamic "Autopilot" Group

I created a dynamic group to include all devices with the "FRLAB" category.

<Callout type="warn">
During the creation of the dynamic group, Microsoft will display an error message as long as no device with the "FRLAB" category exists. Now that I have a device with the "FRLAB" category, it works.
</Callout>

![Dynamic Group Autopilot Devices](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-dynamic-group-1.png)

I used the "FRLAB" category, so I configured the dynamic group with this rule: `(device.devicePhysicalIds -any "_ -startsWith "[OrderID]:FRLAB")`

![Dynamic Group Autopilot Devices 2](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-dynamic-group-2.png)

I can see my first VM in it.

![Dynamic Group Autopilot Devices 3](/images/intune/intune-lab/m365-business-premium-tenant-intune-lab-dynamic-group-3.png)

## Assigning the Autopilot Profile to the Dynamic Group

By navigating to "Devices > Enrollment > Windows Autopilot deployment profiles", I configured the "Autopilot Full Cloud" profile.

![Linking Autopilot Profile to Dynamic Group 1](/images/intune/intune-lab/link-autopilot-full-cloud-to-dynamicgroup-1.png)

Then, I added the dynamic group to the "Included groups".

![Linking Autopilot Profile to Dynamic Group 2](/images/intune/intune-lab/link-autopilot-full-cloud-to-dynamicgroup-2.png)

This means that when I enroll another VM with the "FRLAB" category, the dynamic group will automatically pick up the device, and the Autopilot profile will be assigned to it.
