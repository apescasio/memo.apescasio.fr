title: Configure a lab Intune
---
## Context

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.

To better understand Intune, I decided to set up an Intune lab; that is, to create my own tenant, create my own Autopilot profiles...

This allowed me to explore Intune's features, such as device management, profile configuration, and application deployment.

This guide details the steps I followed to configure an Intune tenant and manage devices centrally.

## Creating a Tenant with Microsoft 365 Business Premium

First, you need to create a [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products) account, which has a completely free option.

Personally, I chose the 30-day free trial of "Microsoft 365 Business Premium" to gain access to Intune.

Once everything is set up, I log in for the first time to the tenant's admin account to enable MFA.

For best practices, I always use a browser in private mode when logging into the admin account (to avoid keeping cache).
</Callout>

To avoid any surprises with billing, I canceled the 30-day free trial in advance.

After a few clicks and about 3 minutes of waiting, I had an Intune lab and an Azure tenant ready.

The only account I have is properly assigned the Microsoft 365 Business Premium license, which includes Intune and Azure AD Premium P1.
