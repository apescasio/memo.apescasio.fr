## Context

I am not a doctor, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio’s notes. 

Back in my high school days, I used to retype again and again my notes for Histoire Géo and other classes on the keyboard. 

Years later, I created this A.R.T Python App to train my word per minute and my memory. 

I type as fast as I can and while typing, I repeat each phrase in my mind. 

For those who prefer to watch [an actual video that covers everything step-by-step](https://youtube.com/@apescasio).

## A.R.T Python App

The base of the code comes from [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ5i1kJAA6Y), who I highly recommend to watch for Python projects to create.

Tim's code is available in his [GitHub](https://github.com/techwithtim/WPM_Typing_Test).

The changes I've done to the code were: 

- Remove the random selection of phrases in the txt file
- Possibility to escape after each phrase
- Keep track of each cycle
- Have an average of WPM—after each cycle

## Folder Structure 

<Files>
  <Folder name="C:\Alzheimers-Resistance-Training" defaultOpen>
    <File name="inputs.txt" />
    <File name="train.py" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

## A.R.T Python App Execution

If you have not installed Python yet, install it with this PowerShell command.

```ps1 title="install-python"
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12

### VSCode Editor ###

winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

You will need to have pip and the module `windows-curses` installed.

```ps1 title="install-pip"
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
pip --version
pip install windows-curses
```

Then, create a new Python file and fill it up with this code.

```py title="train.py"
import curses
from curses import wrapper
import time
import random

def start_screen(stdscr):
	stdscr.clear()
	stdscr.addstr("Welcome to the Speed Typing Test!")
	stdscr.addstr("\nPress any key to begin!")
	stdscr.refresh()
	stdscr.getkey()

def display_text(stdscr, target, current, wpm=0):
	stdscr.addstr(target)
	stdscr.addstr(1, 0, f"WPM: {wpm}")

	for i, char in enumerate(current):
		correct_char = target[i]
		color = curses.color_pair(1)
		if char != correct_char:
			color = curses.color_pair(2)

		stdscr.addstr(0, i, char, color)

def load_text(line_index=0):
	with open("inputs.txt", "r") as f:
		lines = f.readlines()
		### Remove empty lines ###
		lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if line.strip()]
		if not lines:
			return "No text found in inputs.txt", 0
		### Return the line at the current index and the total number of lines ###
		return lines[line_index % len(lines)], len(lines)

def wpm_test(stdscr, line_index=0, cycle=1):
	target_text, total_lines = load_text(line_index)
	current_text = []
	wpm = 0
	start_time = time.time()
	stdscr.nodelay(True)

	while True:
		time_elapsed = max(time.time() - start_time, 1)
		wpm = round((len(current_text) / (time_elapsed / 60)) / 5)

		stdscr.clear()
		display_text(stdscr, target_text, current_text, wpm)
		current_line = (line_index % total_lines) + 1
		stdscr.addstr(2, 0, f"Cycle {cycle} - Line {current_line} of {total_lines}")
		stdscr.refresh()

		if "".join(current_text) == target_text:
			stdscr.nodelay(False)
			### Calculate final WPM for this phrase ###
			final_time = time.time() - start_time
			final_wpm = round((len(target_text) / (final_time / 60)) / 5)
			break

		try:
			key = stdscr.getkey()
		except:
			continue

		if ord(key) == 27:
			final_wpm = 0  # If escaped, no WPM recorded
			break

		if key in ("KEY_BACKSPACE", '\b', "\x7f"):
			if len(current_text) > 0:
				current_text.pop()
		elif len(current_text) < len(target_text):
			current_text.append(key)

	return line_index + 1, cycle, final_wpm


def main(stdscr):
	curses.init_pair(1, curses.COLOR_GREEN, curses.COLOR_BLACK)
	curses.init_pair(2, curses.COLOR_RED, curses.COLOR_BLACK)
	curses.init_pair(3, curses.COLOR_WHITE, curses.COLOR_BLACK)

	start_screen(stdscr)
	line_index = 0
	cycle = 1
	wpm_results = []  ### Store WPM for each phrase in current cycle ###
	cycle_averages = []  ### Store average WPM for each completed cycle ###

	### Get the total number of lines to know when to increment cycle ###
	_, total_lines = load_text(0)
	
	while True:
		line_index, cycle, phrase_wpm = wpm_test(stdscr, line_index, cycle)
		wpm_results.append(phrase_wpm)

		### Check if we've completed all lines and need to start a new cycle ###
		if line_index >= total_lines:
			### Calculate average for this cycle ###
			if wpm_results:
				cycle_average = round(sum(wpm_results) / len(wpm_results))
				cycle_averages.append(cycle_average)
			
			line_index = 0
			cycle += 1
			wpm_results = []  ### Reset for new cycle ###

		stdscr.clear()
		stdscr.addstr(0, 0, "You completed the text! Press any key to continue...")
		stdscr.addstr(1, 0, "Press ESC to quit.")

		### Show cycle averages if we have completed at least one cycle ###
		
		if cycle_averages:
			stdscr.addstr(3, 0, "Cycle Averages (WPM):")
			for i, avg in enumerate(cycle_averages):
				stdscr.addstr(4 + i, 0, f"  Cycle {i + 1}: {avg} WPM")
		
		stdscr.refresh()
		key = stdscr.getkey()
		
		if ord(key) == 27:
			break

wrapper(main)

```

You'll also need to have a `inputs.txt` file (containing the phrases) inside the same folder.

```txt title="inputs.txt"
Hello World. 
One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
Repetition is simply the Mother of Learning.
This is my culture, my open-source contributions, and my passion for sharing knowledge.
```
Lastly, here's a test drive of the app.

I converted the .mkv file to .gif as the mkv file size is too large.

## Post A.R.T Python App Ramblings

I did recently buy a walking treadmill, so I’ll be able to train while walking. 

According to some Alzheimer’s studies, walking can help with maintaining cognitive health and improvements in processing speed.

- NBC => [Alzheimer's may be delayed](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna221024)
- CNN => [Start walking](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/07/28/health/alzheimers-disease-walking-exercise-wellness)

Also, I have a grandpa who can still drive a jeep at 85 years of age. Obviously not driving everyday but on very rare occasions—he's able to do it.

According to him, his body and mind are healthy, thanks to walking and only eating fish and mungo. He avoids all other meats.

My aim with this [channel](https://youtube.com/@apescasio) is to record the free and open-source projects that I did to learn a language like Python, and AI, and Microsoft tools.

Like many people have said: to actually learn a language like Python, you should not only follow tutorials but instead, create your own projects. For example, I followed this tutorial of Tech with Tim to create the WPM app, afterwards I transformed it myself, to an application that I would actually be using. 

I also used other languages like JavaScript, to create MUNDO.APESCASIO.FR, to share my journey as an insignificant traveler through a clickable 3D world map—one instagram, one country, one city, one culture. 

My next video in September will be on the creation of ISO. A Copilot Studio Agent AI for IT department. And for HR department, it will be MIDL.
