## What is `git` / `GitHub`?

**git** is a powerful tool that acts like a time machine for your projects. It keeps track of every change you make to your code, allowing you to revert to a previous state if needed. Think of it like a logbook or a photo album for your project, where each commit represents an important milestone or a "snapshot" of your work's progress.

On top of that, git is a "conductor" for collaborative work. When multiple people work on the same project, it ensures everyone can contribute without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. Thanks to its branching feature, it allows you to explore different ideas or features without risking the main project.

**GitHub**, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform that acts as a library for your git projects. It allows you to store, share, and collaborate on code with other developers while providing tools to track contributions and manage projects efficiently.
