I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes.
</Callout>

During my training as a Network Systems and Security Administrator at IPI, I got into the habit of noting down what I learned: scripts, useful commands, ideas in Word files.

But finally, I decided to create this site to centralize my notes and make them more accessible.
This is a simple way to keep track of my journey + evolution, and maybe share a bit with others.
