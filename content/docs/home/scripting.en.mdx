title: Why I do scripting

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import DynamicCallout from '../../../components/DynamicCalloutHome';

## Use case
There are tasks that, while essential, quickly become repetitive and a "time consumer".

For example, during my first apprenticeship within a group of universities, when receiving a new PC to configure, one of the common steps was to install an antivirus.

If you rely on the manual method, it goes like this:

<DynamicCallout>
<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Access the shared folder 
    where the antivirus installation file is located *(~10 seconds)*. 
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Identify the most recent .msi file
    among the files *(~3 seconds)*.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run as admin 
    to start the installation *(~3 seconds)*.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Click "Next" 3 times
    to finalize the installation *(~60 seconds)*.
  </Step>
</Steps>
</DynamicCallout>
## PowerShell Script

After doing this a few times, I realized how repetitive and time-consuming this process becomes, especially when there are multiple computers to configure. That’s when I thought: Why not automate all of this?

That’s how I decided to create a PowerShell script. Here’s what it does:

```ps1 {title="silentinstall.ps1"}
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

### Check and create the "log" folder if necessary ###

$log_folder = "C:\ProgramData\Logs"
if (-not (Test-Path -Path $log_folder)) {
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $log_folder -Force
}

### Start transcription ###

$date = $(Get-Date -Format 'dd-MM-yyyy_HH-mm-ss')
Start-Transcript -Path "$log_folder\$date-Install-ANTIVIRUS.log" -Force

### Check if the ANTIVIRUS program is already installed ###

### If the program is not installed, install the most recent .msi file ###

$antivirus_folder = "C:\Program Files\ANTIVIRUS"
if (-not (Test-Path -Path $antivirus_folder)) {
    $all_msi = Get-ChildItem -Path "\\adds01\ANTIVIRUS\" -Filter "*.msi" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending
    $newest = $all_msi[0].FullName

    Write-Host "Installing the most recent ANTIVIRUS: $newest"

    ### Install the .msi file silently (no graphical interface) ###

    Start-Process -FilePath "msiexec.exe" -ArgumentList "/i `"$newest`" /qn" -Wait

    Write-Host "Installation completed."
} else {
    Write-Host "ANTIVIRUS is already installed."
}

### Stop transcription ###

Stop-Transcript
```

In just a few lines of code, I transformed a repetitive task into a simple automated action.

And that’s what I love about scripting: saving time, reducing errors, and above all, making tasks more efficient.
