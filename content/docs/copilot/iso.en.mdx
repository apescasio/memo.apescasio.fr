## Context

« **Arise ISO. Please reset the method of authentication for Kdot.** »

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio’s notes. 

A friend of mine recently sprained her wrist from doing lots of gymnastics, and I was receiving lots of voice messages.

This experience inspired me to use Voice Control on iPhone and Voice Access on Windows to run voice commands through AI Agents in Copilot Studio, creating a more intuitive and « hands-free » way to work.

For those who prefer to watch [an actual video that covers everything step-by-step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW2gVkjYrAw).

![Intelligent-Systems-Optimization (ISO)](/images/copilot/iso.png)

## Insignificant Student

As a student, my aim is to make money, without spending any. 

So I made use of the [30 days trial of Microsoft 365 Business Premium](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-premium?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and the [30 days trial of Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/thesource-developer/Event/38/sign-up-for-copilot-studio-trial%23:~:text=Sign%2520up%2520for%2520a%2520free,the%2520instructions%2520to%2520get%2520started.).

Whether it be testing Azure tenant, Intune, or M365 Copilot AI, I make do with the time that I have. 

## I.S.O AI Agent Copilot Studio

To make the AI Agent, I go to copilotstudio.microsoft.com, this is where you can manage your AI agents. 

In this video, I’ll be creating an AI for IT department, which I’ll be calling ISO.

```txt title="iso-details.txt"

Name: ISO Mark II.

Description: Purpose of ISO (Intelligent Systems Optimization) is to assist with recurring tasks in a semi-automated way—always with a human in the loop. 

This will never be about replacing people or automating every step from A to Z. It’s about empowering individuals to work more efficiently, while preserving the essence of human judgment, creativity, and care.

I believe in coexistence with AI, not domination by it. Just as we learn from different cultures, we can grow alongside intelligent systems. 

AI can help us grow—not replace what makes us human.
```


Most companies make use of paid third party API, to do actions like Reset MFA, Multi-Factor-Authentication.

There’s also other actions like Reset Password, where the AI asks the user which mail needs to have a password reset and the other mail that can receive the actual password. 

I'll be redoing the Reset MFA for free, so I'll be using Graph API.

## I.S.O AI Agent Enterprise App

To use Graph API, I create an Enterprise Application in Azure, and I give it the necessary rights to perform the action Reset MFA. 

Then I generate a Client Secret and I note down: the Tenant ID + Client ID + Client Secret as I'll be using them in the workflows of the AI. 

Essentially, instead of logging in Azure and resetting the MFA myself manually => I create an application that would be accessible by the AI.

        appRoleId   = $perm.Id
    } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3

    Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method POST -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/$($sp.Id)/appRoleAssignments" -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
}

Write-Host "`nApp 'ISO AI Agent Copilot' created with Application permissions (UserAuthenticationMethod.Read/ReadWrite.All) and admin consent granted successfully." -ForegroundColor Green
```

## Topics AI Agent 

Every AI Agents have what we call topics and essentially => they are workflows. 

For example, you can create a topic that would send someone a mail, if you send a specific message to the AI.

For my AI, I ended up creating 4 topics total for now. 

## Topic 1 `End Conversation`

I created this topic so that, if you send the message: « exit » or « quit » => the AI will end the conversation.

```yaml title="end-conversation.yaml"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnRecognizedIntent
  id: main
  intent:
    triggerQueries:
      - exit
      - quit
      - stop
      - end conversation
      - stark@lethimcook.fr

  actions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_zbuT5w
      activity: Quitted conversation.

    - kind: EndConversation
      id: 38Aaio

inputType: {}
outputType: {}
```

## Topic 2 `Global Variables`

This topic is to store the values of « Global Variables » like Tenant ID, Client ID, etc.

```yaml title="global-variables.yaml"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnRecognizedIntent
  id: main
  intent:
    triggerQueries:
      - Arise

  actions:
    - kind: SetVariable

outputType: {}
```

## Topic 3 `Reset MFA`

This one is for the action Reset MFA, where I use the « Global Variables » and Graph API to actually run the action. So if you send the message Reset MFA to the AI, this specific topic would activate.

        speak:
          - Hello and thank you for calling {System.Bot.Name}. Please note that some responses are generated by AI and may require verification for accuracy. How may I help you today?
```

## I.S.O AI Agent Execution

You can chat with the AI Agent in Teams by simply going to Channels => Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot => and clicking on See agent in Teams. 

You can share it with other users by clicking on Availability Options. 

After sending the trigger phrase, the AI will then ask for the user's email that needs to have their method of authentication deleted. 

The AI will then use the Azure application to authenticate and check if the user currently has a method or not, if it does have a method, then the method gets deleted. If no method is found, then the AI simply sends a message to say so. That's pretty much it.

## Experimental Topic `Reset MFA for Kdot`

Instead of manually writing the user's email every time, I created a topic that has a trigger phrase and variables specifically for Kdot. This is very manual and not that good of an idea, it's just an experiment.

## iOS Voice Control 

I made use of the Vocabulary functionality in my iPhone's Voice Control setting so it's actually fitted to my own voice.

**Settings => Accessibility => Voice Control => Vocabulary**

« **One must imagine Sisyphus happy.** »

And, I also turned on the Accessibility Shortcut.

**Settings => Accessibility => Accessibility Shortcut => Voice Control**

## Windows Voice Access

You have the same functionality in Windows through Voice Access.

**Windows key => Shift => S key**

## I.S.O AI Agent Restrictions on VIP Accounts

To prevent the AI from touching VIP accounts, I simply added the user's email into the topic « End Conversation ». This means that if someone tries to Reset MFA of stark@lethimcook.fr => the AI will end the conversation.

## Post I.S.O AI Agent Ramblings

My aim is coexistence with AI, the same way we share and learn from different cultures in our world. AI can help us grow—not replace what makes us human.

The best advice that I follow myself once a month, is to break it all and rebuild it all back, again and again. 

Once a month, I reformat my PC and I put everything back together via PowerShell. 

Once a month, I break my lab tenant, and I do everything again, whether it be creating Copilot AI Agents, or Intune Full Cloud Autopilots. 

I'm still learning in my 6th cycle, and I still will be in the 7th, the 8th, the 9th and so on. 

Repetition is simply the Mother of Learning. 

Everything I showed so far remains manual, but I’ll figure something out towards the end of this cycle or in the next.

For the next video on AI, I plan on doing a Copilot Agent for HR department, focusing on frequently asked questions like: « Currently, how many paid day offs I can submit to my boss ? », and so on.
