## Context

« **Arise MIDL. How many paid day-offs am I allowed?** »

« **How many days am I allowed to work from home?** »

I am not a teacher, this is my own, an insignificant student, Aaron (Iso) Pescasio's notes. 

To learn about SharePoint and custom lists, I decided to create an AI Agent that would give me the policies of the current user's company.

For those who prefer to watch [an actual video that covers everything step-by-step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkmgBL_3M8U).

## Insignificant Student

As a student, my aim is to make money, without spending any. 

So I made use of the [30 days trial of Microsoft 365 Business Premium](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-premium?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and the [30 days trial of Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/thesource-developer/Event/38/sign-up-for-copilot-studio-trial%23:~:text=Sign%2520up%2520for%2520a%2520free,the%2520instructions%2520to%2520get%2520started.).

Whether it be testing Azure tenant, Intune, or M365 Copilot AI, I make do with the time that I have. 

## M.I.D.L AI Agent Copilot Studio

To make the AI Agent, I go to copilotstudio.microsoft.com, this is where you can manage your AI agents. 

In this video, I'll be creating an AI for HR department, which I'll be calling MIDL.

```txt title="iso-details.txt"

Name: MIDL Mark II.

Description: Purpose of MIDL (Morals Integrity Discipline Listen) is to assist with recurring tasks in a semi-automated way—always with a human in the loop. 

This will never be about replacing people or automating every step from A to Z. It's about empowering individuals to work more efficiently, while preserving the essence of human judgment, creativity, and care.

I believe in coexistence with AI, not domination by it. Just as we learn from different cultures, we can grow alongside intelligent systems. 

AI can help us grow—not replace what makes us human.
```

The AI will be using a custom list in SharePoint, to get for example => the company policies regarding paid day-offs.

## M.I.D.L SharePoint Site's Custom Lists

To be able to use PowerShell for SharePoint, I installed the version 7 of PowerShell.

```ps1
winget install -e --id Microsoft.PowerShell

if (-not (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name PnP.PowerShell)) {
    Install-Module PnP.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber
}
```
In my fresh lab tenant, I registered a PnP application in Azure, so that I can run PowerShell commands to connect to SharePoint Online.

```ps1 title="pnp-entra.ps1"
### To connect to SharePoint Online, you need to register an application in Azure AD and give it the required permissions ###

Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName "PnP PowerShell" -Tenant LabOfApes.onmicrosoft.com

### Connect to SharePoint Online ###

Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://labofapes-admin.sharepoint.com" -ClientId "fill_with_clientid_of_application" -Interactive

```

After connecting, I can now create the SharePoint Site => Connect to the newly created site => Create the custom list inside of the site => Fill the list up with values.

```ps1 title="midl-site-custom-list.ps1"
### Create the SharePoint Site ### 

New-PnPTenantSite -Title "MIDL" `
                  -Url "https://labofapes.sharepoint.com/sites/MIDL" `
                  -Template "STS#3" `
                  -Owner "fool@apescasio.fr" `
                  -TimeZone 4 `
                  -Lcid 1033

### Connect to the SharePoint Site ###

Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://labofapes.sharepoint.com/sites/MIDL" -ClientId "fill_with_clientid_of_application" -Interactive

### Create the custom list in the site ###

New-PnPList -Title "company-policies" -Template GenericList

### Fill the list up with columns and values ###

Add-PnPField -List "company-policies" -DisplayName "Country" -InternalName "Country" -Type Text -AddToDefaultView
Add-PnPField -List "company-policies" -DisplayName "Company" -InternalName "Company" -Type Text -AddToDefaultView
Add-PnPField -List "company-policies" -DisplayName "PolicyType" -InternalName "PolicyType" -Type Choice -Choices "PaidDayOff","RemoteWork" -AddToDefaultView
Add-PnPField -List "company-policies" -DisplayName "Explanation" -InternalName "Explanation" -Type Note -AddToDefaultView

### FR LabOfApes - Paid Leave ###

Add-PnPListItem -List "company-policies" -Values @{
    Title = "FR-LabOfApes-PaidDayOff";
    Country = "France";
    Company = "LabOfApes";
    PolicyType = "PaidDayOff";
    Explanation = "Employees are entitled to 4 paid leave days per month of effective work with the same employer."
}

### FR LabOfApes - Remote Work ###

Add-PnPListItem -List "company-policies" -Values @{
    Title = "FR-LabOfApes-RemoteWork";
    Country = "France";
    Company = "LabOfApes";
    PolicyType = "RemoteWork";
    Explanation = "Employees are entitled to 3 days of remote work per week."
}

### US LabOfApes - Paid Leave ###

Add-PnPListItem -List "company-policies" -Values @{
    Title = "US-LabOfApes-PaidDayOff";
    Country = "United States";
    Company = "LabOfApes";
    PolicyType = "PaidDayOff";
    Explanation = "Employees are entitled to 2 paid leave days per month of effective work with the same employer."
}

### US LabOfApes - Remote Work ###

Add-PnPListItem -List "company-policies" -Values @{
    Title = "US-LabOfApes-RemoteWork";
    Country = "United States";
    Company = "LabOfApes";
    PolicyType = "RemoteWork";
    Explanation = "Employees are entitled to 1 day of remote work per week."
}
```
## Topics AI Agent 

Every AI Agents have what we call topics and essentially => they are workflows.

For example, you can create a topic that would send someone a mail, if you send a specific message to the AI.

For my AI, I ended up creating 5 topics total for now. 

## Topic 1 `End Conversation`

I created this topic so that, if you send the message: « exit » or « quit » => the AI will end the conversation.

```yaml title="end-conversation.yaml"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnRecognizedIntent
  id: main
  intent:
    triggerQueries:
      - exit
      - quit
      - stop
      - end conversation

  actions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_zbuT5w
      activity: Quitted conversation.

    - kind: EndConversation
      id: 38Aaio

inputType: {}
outputType: {}
```

## Topic 2 `Global Variables`

This topic is to store the values of « Global Variables » like the current user's Country, Company name and so on. 

I did put my account to be used by the AI for authentication, this is obviously not best practice.

In the next cycle, I'll try to make the AI use a service account instead. 

```yaml title="global-variables.yaml"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnRecognizedIntent
  id: main
  intent:
    triggerQueries:
      - Arise

  actions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_MIDL
      activity: |-
        Hello {System.User.DisplayName}, I'm {System.Bot.Name}, your partner in Morals, Integrity, Discipline, and Listen.

        Together, we create a workplace where people come first, and systems work smarter.

        I'm here to help you with your HR-related questions and requests, guided by:
        - **M**orals: fairness, respect, and purpose!
        - **I**ntegrity: transparency, accuracy, and trust!
        - **D**iscipline: consistency, reliability, and timeliness!
        - **L**istening: attentiveness to your needs and continuous learning!

inputType: {}
outputType: {}
```

## Topic 3 `Get PaidDayOffs`

This one is to get the explanation regarding the Paid Leave policy from the list in SharePoint. 

I use the « Global Variables » and my account for authentication. 

So if you send the trigger phrase to the AI, this specific topic would activate.

In the filter, I make use of the current user's Country, Company name and PolicyType.
 
```yaml title="get-paiddayoffs.yaml"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

### Filter => "Country eq '" & Global.UserProfile_V2.country & "' and Company eq '" & Global.UserProfile_V2.companyName & "' and PolicyType eq 'PaidDayOff'" ###

kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnRecognizedIntent
  id: main
  intent:
    triggerQueries:
      - How many paid day-offs am I allowed ?
 
  actions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_OmGd7f
      activity: |-
        Referring to the HR's SharePoint for the organization's policies...
        - User's Country:
        {Global.UserProfile_V2.country}
        - User's Company:
        {Global.UserProfile_V2.companyName}
        - User's Department:  {Global.UserProfile_V2.department}
        - User's Email: {Global.UserProfile_V2.userPrincipalName}
 
    - kind: SetVariable
      id: setVariable_FwLzaa
      variable: Topic.explanation_only
      value: =First(Topic.GetItems.value).Explanation
 
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_FbLffN
      activity: |-
        Here's {Global.UserProfile_V2.companyName}' paid day-off policy for employees in {Global.UserProfile_V2.country}:
        - {Topic.explanation_only}
 
inputType: {}
outputType: {}
```

## Topic 4 `Get RemoteWork`

The 4th topic is to get the explanation regarding the Remote Work policy from the list in SharePoint.

```yaml title="get-remotework.yaml"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

### Filter => "Country eq '" & Global.UserProfile_V2.country & "' and Company eq '" & Global.UserProfile_V2.companyName & "' and PolicyType eq 'RemoteWork'" ###

kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:

        - User's Department:  {Global.UserProfile_V2.department}
        - User's Email: {Global.UserProfile_V2.userPrincipalName}
 
    - kind: SetVariable
      id: setVariable_FwLzaa
      variable: Topic.explanation_only
      value: =First(Topic.GetItems.value).Explanation
 
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_FbLffN
      activity: |-

        - {Topic.explanation_only}
 
inputType: {}
outputType: {}
```
## Topic 5 `Conversation Start`

The last topic is to simply introduce my AI at every start of conversation.
```yaml title="conversation-start.yaml"
### © Aaron (Iso) Pescasio / www.apescasio.fr ###

kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnConversationStart
  id: main
  actions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_pm8Kty
      activity: |-
        Hello {System.User.DisplayName}, I'm {System.Bot.Name}, your partner in Morals, Integrity, Discipline, and Listen.

        Together, we create a workplace where ethics meet efficiency, where people come first, and systems work smarter.

        I'm here to help you with your HR-related questions and requests, guided by:
        - **M**orals: fairness, respect, and purpose!
        - **I**ntegrity: transparency, accuracy, and trust!
        - **D**iscipline: consistency, reliability, and timeliness!
        - **L**istening: attentiveness to your needs and continuous learning!
```

## M.I.D.L AI Agent Execution

You can chat with the AI Agent in Teams by simply going to Channels => Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot => and clicking on See agent in Teams. 

You can share it with other users by clicking on Availability Options. 

After sending the trigger phrase, the AI will then send the current user's Country, Company name, Department and Email.

The AI will then check the custom list values of my SharePoint Site. 

As there is a Country column that has the value "France" and a Company column that has the value "LabOfApes", the AI will simply return the value of the column "Explanation" to me.

If I want another Company's policy, I'll simply add another Row and fill it up with the other Company name, Country, and so on.

That's pretty much it.

## Post M.I.D.L AI Agent Ramblings

I'm not satisfied with the custom list, I can do better. 

The best advice that I follow myself once a month, is to break it all and rebuild it all back, again and again. 

Once a month, I reformat my PC and I put everything back together via PowerShell. 

Once a month, I break my lab tenant, and I do everything again, whether it be creating Copilot AI Agents, or Intune Full Cloud Autopilots. 

I'm still learning in my 7th cycle, and I still will be in the 8th, the 9th, and so on. 

Repetition is simply the Mother of Learning. 

Everything I showed so far remains manual, but I'll figure something out towards the end of this cycle or in the next.
